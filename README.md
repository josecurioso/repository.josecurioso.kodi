# Josecurioso's addons
------------------------

Kodi repository for addons either created by me or forked and modified. You can download it from the release page and, once installed, it will auto-update itself and its addons whenever new releases are available.

## Current contents:
- service.subtitles.tusubtitulo: Addon service for downloading from Tusubtitulo.com, useful for English/Spanish speakers
- repository.josecurioso.kodi: The repo itself

## Collaborating
There are individual repositories for each submodule (except the repo itself) so feel free to visit them and create a pull request with your additions. I'll review it as soon as I can. Where to find them:
- [service.subtitles.tusubtitulo](https://github.com/josecurioso2/service.subtitles.tusubtitulo)
